Here I go again, lost in my own thoughts.

---

Today, Bilibili recommended some rather peculiar psychology videos to me.

Curious, I clicked and watched. Every single point hit me hard.

Could it be that I'm truly unwell, but everyone's just been keeping it from me?

I have no idea.

But then,

Why do I know nothing at all?

I don't know how to study effectively.

I don't know how to connect with others.

I don't know... how to set myself free.

I... I'm just so tired.
