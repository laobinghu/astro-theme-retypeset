# 25.9.15
Haven't found the way forward yet.

A few days ago, I dug out this notebook and found this unfinished piece of writing. Originally, I read a stream-of-consciousness essay by [Tang Jun](https://blog.tsxc.xyz) and wanted to write one myself [too](https://log.eaverse.top/memos/nXTpFYVWRbGSvWbErH7ozJ). But what I ended up writing was nonsensical and incomplete. Since I have some free time today, I finally finished the rest.

Life is just like the string of a qin—if the string breaks, life loses its meaning. Actually, things were okay before; at least I still had a sense of purpose keeping me going. But ever since I was diagnosed with depression, even that purpose has faded away. Right now, I’m just barely holding on to life.

Suddenly, I realized I don’t like information technology that much. Could origami be the true passion of my heart instead?

It’s raining again. It’s pouring heavily, and the outside is shrouded in a white haze.

The weather is perfect for sleeping, but I just can’t fall asleep. Though it doesn’t matter anyway—sooner or later, I’ll sleep forever.

This morning, I made an appointment for counseling. I originally wanted to book a slot for this afternoon, but it was already taken. Honestly, it doesn’t matter when I go; I don’t know if these few days will make any difference.

Tomorrow, I still have to interview new recruits. I’ll be pretty busy.

I want to go to Xiaojian to watch the stars.

Why is it raining again? My shoes are wet once more.

Why do they keep pushing me around... Am I supposed to take on all the roles by myself? Everything is dumped on me—am I a superhero or something...

This afternoon, the Converged Media Department is recruiting new members. I don’t know if the teacher will let me go. I have a feeling we won’t get many people with actual skills.

Well, the candidates are decent enough, but why on earth did they take the interview forms away?

It’s so cold... I don’t want to move.

Why do we have to stay until after evening self-study to leave school tomorrow? Brother Ji, are you abandoning your parents?

# 25.9.19
Congratulations to Brother Ji for finally getting to care for his parents again—we get off after four classes this afternoon.

The weather is really nice today; perfect for sleeping.

I’m going to my counseling session this afternoon. I don’t know if Sister Yu will let me go. If she doesn’t, I’ll just leave anyway.

Turns out the dent on Sister Feng’s head was from a fall when she was a kid. No wonder. Actually, being a bit scatterbrained like this isn’t so bad—living without overthinking things could work too.
