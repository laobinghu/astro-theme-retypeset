Today's fortune was terrible.

I once purchased 200 pure origin stones, equivalent to 61 pulls, to try for Lingyin Silver Ash, but failed. Instead, I got two copies of a certain sister's Saint Listening First Snow. I was angry and wanted to buy another 200 origin stones, but my friend advised me against it. I finally calmed down, thought about my operators, realized I lacked crowd control units, not specialized counter units. Thus my anger subsided.

However, I visited my teacher at night, wanting to know when we would take group photos, only to find out they had already been taken. Someone said: "I once told a high school vice department member to inform you when they met, but they didn't know you." At that moment, my lungs felt like exploding, my head grew dizzier, and I left feeling dejected.

Back in class, I saw the English homework was very little, with the deadline being evening self-study session 2. By session 3, I saw three people clutching answer keys, writing furiously, while everyone else was wailing in despair, shifting their anger onto them. I felt unhappy in my heart, sensed chest tightness, so I wrote this piece to vent my frustration.

This humble one truly has no solutions. Can any readers have a solution to tell me?

Alas, how unpleasant!
