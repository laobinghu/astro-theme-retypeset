In middle school, every time I took Bus 80 to Youxian and saw the building on the left with the sign "Mianyang Zhongxue Yingcai School," I felt a mix of emotions.

On one hand, if I had passed the entrance exam back then, I would have been one step closer to my dreams. On the other hand, it also meant a higher academic pressure.

But looking back now, I think I made the right choice.

Otherwise, my mental health issues wouldn’t just be showing slight signs now—they would have erupted during middle school.
