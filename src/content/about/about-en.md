## Yi Wei's Musings

Yi Xi is Yi Wei, Yi Guang is also Yi Wei—these three are distinct personalities of the same individual. Yi Wei serves as the core personality (Realism), Yi Xi represents Yi Wei's past (carefree in memories), while Yi Guang embodies Yi Wei's idealized self (thus Idealism).

This means Yi Wei bears most of the suffering, yet aren't Yi Xi and Yi Guang also manifestations of escapism?

I don't know. I can be Yi Wei, Yi Xi, or Yi Guang—whichever personality I choose. Why not dissolve life's pains in a Yellow Millet—Dream?

But not in the Panopticon. Those people always find reasons to force your submission. The past is certain; the future is beautiful. But reality?

Reality is simply this tragic.

## Profiles of the Trio
### Yi Xi
**Verdict**:
Past me was the "model child" in others' eyes. In many ways, I was enviable. But the past remains the past; that version of me survives only in fantasies of bygone days.

Past me has long died within those memories.

**Identity**:
My deceased past self (aka Laobing/Pancake)

**Symbolism**:
Yi Xi → Already Dead (Phonetic wordplay)

### Yi Wei
**Identity**:
Realist/Escapist

**Symbolism**:
Only the present/One-dimensional time → No choices

**Verdict**:
Current me is defeated, living in others' shadows. I might be the "me" without glory—crushed by circumstances. The tragedy? This is reality: stark and undeniable.

And inescapable.

### Yi Guang

**Identity**:
Idealist

**Verdict**:
This me is the long-cherished "me"—unburdened by logic, standing atop the summit. That "me" must be blissful there...

Yet idealism remains idealism precisely because of its unbridgeable chasm with reality.
